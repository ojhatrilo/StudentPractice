1.
    write a python program to add two numbers given bellow a=55 and b=22
    store the answer in a new variable
    multiply the answer with a 
    store the multiplied answer in new varaible 
    compare the multiplied answer with value a 
    if the answer is greater then multiply the answer with (pi)value
    increment the answer by 34
    and decrement the answer by 20 
    then compare the value of all the present solution
